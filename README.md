This is a website where you can use a GUI to create templates for some of the popular docker managment utilities (yacht, portainer, unraid, docker-compose) It's still very much a work in progress but feel free to take a look. Once it's functioning at a basic level I'll be deploying this so anyone can use it 100% free (possibly ad supported).
